# Let-s-play-FIFA
Ranking players, classifying player positions and finding club having best staff

Football/Soccer is the most popular sport
worldwide and EA Sports FIFA is amongst the
most popular games. Every year, EA Sports
models the real-world performance of players,
clubs and nations by rating and ranking them. By
using the data of previous editions of FIFA, we
aim to perform the same ranking and predictions
EA Sports does on an annual basis.
The goal of this project is three-fold:
• Ranking players
• Predicting their positions
• Finding clubs with best staffs.
